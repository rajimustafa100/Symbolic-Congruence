# Symbolic Congruence in Brand Messaging with a Machine Learning Pipeline
This repository implements a full data science pipeline to investigate how **symbolic congruence** between a product’s **brand origin** (Global and Local) and its **temporal framing** (Past and Future) influences **consumer engagement**.  
The research is inspired by symbolic branding theories and uses real-world product reviews to analyze behavioral outcomes.

✔ Identifies **temporal orientation** in product descriptions using curated lexicons  
✔ Calculates **average star ratings** and **sentiment polarity** using VADER  
✔ Performs **2×2 ANOVAs**, **planned contrasts**, and **regression models with controls**  
✔ Includes a **Dataset of 4,000 reviews** with clearly modeled interaction effects  
✔ Exports high-quality plots and submission-ready tables for academic publishing
