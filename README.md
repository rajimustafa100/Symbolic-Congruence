# 🧠 Symbolic Congruence in Brand Messaging with a Machine Learning Pipeline
This repository implements a full data science pipeline to investigate how **symbolic congruence** between a product’s **brand origin** (Global and Local) and its **temporal framing** (Past and Future) influences **consumer engagement**.  
The research is inspired by symbolic branding theories and uses real-world product reviews to analyze behavioral outcomes.
