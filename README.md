# Interaction in Brand Messaging with a Machine Learning Pipeline
This repository implements a full data science pipeline to investigate how **interaction** between a product’s **brand origin** (Global and Local) and its **temporal framing** (Past and Future) influences **consumer engagement**.  
The research is inspired by symbolic branding theories and uses real-world product reviews to analyze behavioral outcomes.

## What This Project Does

✔ Classifies **brand origin** using fuzzy string matching and global/local lookup lists  
✔ Identifies **temporal orientation** in product descriptions 
✔ Calculates **average star ratings** and **sentiment polarity** using VADER  
✔ Performs **2×2 ANOVAs**, **planned contrasts**, and **regression models with controls**  
✔ Includes a **Dataset of 400,000 reviews** with clearly modeled interaction effects
